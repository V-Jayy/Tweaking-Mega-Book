## 🧠 About the Project

My name is **Jayy**, and I’ve been a part of the PC tweaking scene for a little over **2 years**. In that time, I’ve worked with over **500+ clients**, released widely-used free tools, and learned a *ton* about what actually works — and what’s just placebo.

This project contaiuns guides, my personal stash of tested tweaks, scripts, and system configs and so much more.
